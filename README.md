This repository is deprecated since the script is now part of MRST. See https://mrst.no or https://bitbucket.org/mrst/mrst-model-io .




~~This repository contains a matlab script for converting meshes in the
Gmsh format to MRST grids.~~

~~Gmsh can be found at
https://gmsh.info~~

~~MRST can be found at
https://mrst.no~~

~~There are numerous examples of grids shipped with gmsh. See the
gmsh/examples and gmsh/tutorials folders.~~

~~The converter in this directory needs the Gmsh grids written in an
m-file format. This can be done in the python interface by
`gmsh.write("grid.m")` or the GUI by saving it as a file with
extension `.m`.~~
